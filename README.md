# Auction Smart Contract

This project is a blockchain-based auction system implemented with Solidity. It features an `Auction` smart contract that allows users to place bids on items and settles the highest bid after a predetermined time.

## Features

- `Auction` contract with bidding and auction settlement functionality.
- Integration with OpenZeppelin's library for robust, secure contract development.
- Time-bound auction process with minimum bid requirements.
- Event emission for bid placement and auction settlement.

## Smart Contract

`Auction.sol` is the main contract that handles the auction logic. It includes functions to place bids, and settle the auction, and ensures that bids are higher than the minimum and only accepted within the auction timeframe.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
